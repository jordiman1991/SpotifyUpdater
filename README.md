# SpotifyUpdater
Update tool for Spotify when dealing with policies.
Maybe this is you; you've got a working computer or laptop. You don't have Microsoft Store on it and policies prevent you to run the automated updates from Spotify.

I did have this issue and I got tired of it! What I did a build a small app that does all the manual work for you.
Normally you would have to go to your AppData > Local > Spotify > Update, run the setup which basically unpackes verything in you AppData > Roaming > Spotify and then copy all new file to you C:\Program Files etc.

Download this app, place a shortcut in your Startup folder and everytime you boot your PC it will handle this laborous event for you.

Nessecary; Make sure your Spotify is installed at C:\Spotify otheriwse the app will not work!
If you have any questions, updates or problems, don't hessitate to contact me!
